# Snake Game

## Description
Window based snake game using Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- `pip` (Python package manager)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashwinkj14/snake_game.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
```bash
cd snake_game
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
```

### 4. Install the Dependencies
Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Application
To start the game, run:

```bash
python game.py
```

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure all required packages are installed by verifying the output of the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
- If Python 3.x isn't the default on your system, use `python3` instead of `python` in the commands above.
